# Xmonad Configuration

Mostly a standard configuration, except for the prompts defined in
`src/XMonad/Prompt`. These are dmenu like switchers for

* launching applications
* the password manager [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/)
* establishing a network-connection with `netctl`
* starting a `openvpn` connection via `systemd`
